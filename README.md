# WorldHappinessReport

The data analysis assignment of the World Happiness Report data that I prepared within the scope of Türk Telekom & TRAI Veri Bilimi ve Analitiği Practicum is attached.

Problem definition and purpose: This data set consists of world happiness reports, which were first published in 2012, ranking 155 countries according to their happiness levels.

Consider 6 factors—economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, corruption prevention, and generosity—to determine the assurance of happiness. The aim is to collect answers by evaluating our world as follows to be happy to contribute to more societies, structures.

Which countries or regions rank highest in overall happiness and among the six factors that contribute to happiness?
How did country rankings or scores change between 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 reports?
Experienced a significant hike or decrease in happiness in any country?

Answers to these questions were sought with the codes prepared on the jupyter notebook.

What steps are done is written under each line of code in jupyter notebook.
